*Queen Lana Portfolio*

## Project Overview
*GUC, Spring 2017, CSEN603*

The purpose of this project was to get introduced to full-stack web development. A website was built using MEAN-stack, and deployed on AWS.

Each user will be able to register to this website and create a portfolio. A portfolio contains the user's name, profile picture and several works by the users. Works can be screenshots, links to websites or code repositories. A client visiting the portfolio will view summary of users' portfolios and can then choose to view the detailed portfolio of a user.
